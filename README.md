# MERN-Stack-Ecommerce
This project was created by @Ariniaina and me during our studies . We used ReactJS for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend. MySQL is used for the client database and MongoDB for the product database. The site is not fully functional yet, and there are many things that still need to be done.
